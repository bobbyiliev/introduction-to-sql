# SELECT

As we briefly covered in the previous chapter, the `SELECT` statement allows us to retrieve data from a specific database.

It corresponds to the projection operation of Relational Algebra.

You can use `SELECT` to get all of your users or a list of users that match a certain criteria.

Before we dive into the `SELECT` statement let's quickly create a database:

```
CREATE DATABASE sql_demo;
```

Switch to that database:

```
USE sql_demo;
```

Create a new users table:

```
CREATE TABLE users
(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    about TEXT,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    birthday DATE,
    active BOOL
);
```

Insert some data that we could work with:

```
INSERT INTO users
  ( username, email, active )
VALUES
  ('bobby', 'b@devdojo.com', true),
  ('devdojo', 'd@devdojo.com', false),
  ('tony', 't@devdojo.com', true);
```

Output:

```
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 3  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

We are going to learn more about the `INSERT` statement in the following chapters.

## SELECT all columns

Now that we've got some data in the `users` table, let's go ahead and retrieve all of the entries from that table:

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Rundown of the statement:

* `SELECT`: first, we specify the action that we want to execute, in our case, we want to select or get some data from the database.
* `*`: the star here indicates that we want to get all of the columns associated with the table that we are selecting from.
* `FROM`: the from statement tells MySQL which table we want to select the data from. You need to keep in mind that you can select from multiple tables, but this is a bit more advanced, and we are going to cover this in the next few chapters
* `users`: this is the table name that we want to select the data from.

This will return all of the entries in the `users` table along with all of the columns:

```
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
| id | username | about | birthday | active | email         |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
|  1 | bobby    | NULL  | NULL     |      1 | b@devdojo.com |
|  2 | devdojo  | NULL  | NULL     |      0 | d@devdojo.com |
|  3 | tony     | NULL  | NULL     |      1 | t@devdojo.com |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

As you can see, we get a list of the 3 users that we've just created, including all of the columns in that table. In some cases, the table might have a lot of columns, and you might not want to see all of them. For example, we have the `about` and `birthday` columns that are all `NULL` at the moment. So let's see how we could limit that and get only a list of specific columns.

## Formatting

As we mentioned in the previous chapters, each SQL statement needs to end with a  semi-colon: `;`. Alternatively, rather than using a  semi-colon, you could use the `\G` characters which would format the output in a list rather than a table.

The syntax is absolutely the same but you just change the `;` with `\G`:

```
SELECT * FROM users \G
```

The output will be formatted like this:

```
*************************** 1. row ***************************
      id: 1
username: bobby
   about: NULL
birthday: NULL
  active: 1
   email: b@devdojo.com
*************************** 2. row ***************************
      id: 2
username: devdojo
   about: NULL
birthday: NULL
  active: 0
   email: d@devdojo.com
...
```

This is very handy whenever your table consists of a large number of columns and they can't fit on the screen, which makes it very hard to read the result set.

## SELECT specific columns only

You could limit this to a specific set of columns. Let's say that you only needed the `username` and the `active` columns. In this case, you would change the `*` symbol with the columns that you want to select divided by a comma:

```
SELECT username,active FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+--------+
| username | active |
+----------+--------+
| bobby    |      1 |
| devdojo  |      0 |
| tony     |      1 |
+----------+--------+
```

As you can see, we are getting back only the 2 columns that we've specified in the `SELECT` statement.

> **NOTE:**  _SQL names are case insensitive. For example, username ≡ USERNAME ≡ userName._

## SELECT with no FROM Clause

In a SQL statement. a column can be a literal with no `FROM` clause.

```
SELECT 'Sunil' as username;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| username |
+----------+
| Sunil    |
+----------+
```

## SELECT with Arithmetic Operations

The select clause can contain arithmetic expressions involving the operation, +, –, *, and /.

```
SELECT username, active*5 as new_active FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+------------+
| username | new_active |
+----------+------------+
| bobby    |          5 |
| devdojo  |          0 |
| tony     |          5 |
+----------+------------+
```

## LIMIT

The `LIMIT` clause is very handy in case that you want to limit the number of results that you get back. For example, at the moment, we have 3 users in our database, but let's say that you only wanted to get 1 entry back when you run the `SELECT` statement.

This can be achieved by adding the `LIMIT` clause at the end of your statement, followed by the number of entries that you want to get. For example, let's say that we wanted to get only 1 entry back. We would run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;
```

Output:

```
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
| id | username | about | birthday | active | email         |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
|  2 | bobby    | NULL  | NULL     |      1 | b@devdojo.com |
+----+----------+-------+----------+--------+---------------+
```

If you wanted to get 2 entries, you would change `LIMIT 2` and so on.

## COUNT

In case that you wanted to get only the number of entries in a specific column, you could use the `COUNT` function. This is a function that I personally use very often.

The syntax is the following:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| COUNT(*) |
+----------+
|        3 |
+----------+
```

## MIN, MAX, AVG, and SUM

Another useful set of functions similar to `COUNT` that would make your life easier are:

* `MIN`: this would give you the smallest value of a specific column. For example, if you had an online shop and you wanted to get the lowest price, you would use the `MIN` function. In our case, if we wanted to get the lowest user ID, we would run the following:

```
SELECT MIN(id) FROM users;
```

This would return `1` as the lowest user ID that we have is 1.

* `MAX`: just like `MIN`, but it would return the highest value:

```
SELECT MAX(id) FROM users;
```

In our case, this would be `3` as we have only 3 users, and the highest value of the `id` column is 3.

* `AVG`: as the name suggests, it would sum up all of the values of a specific column and return the average value. As we have 3 users with ids 1, 2, and 3, the average would be 6 divided by 3 users which is 2. 

```
SELECT AVG(id) FROM users;
```

* `SUM`: this function takes all of the values from the specified column and sums them up:

```
SELECT SUM(id) FROM users;
```

## DISTINCT

In some cases, you might have duplicate entries in a table, and in order to get only the unique values, you could use `DISTINCT`.

To better demonstrate this, let's run the insert statement one more time so that we could duplicate the existing users and have 6 users in the users table:

```
INSERT INTO users
  ( username, email, active )
VALUES
  ('bobby', 'b@devdojo.com', true),
  ('devdojo', 'd@devdojo.com', false),
  ('tony', 't@devdojo.com', true);
```

Now, if you run `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;` you would get `6` back.

Let's also select all users and show only the `username` column:

```
SELECT username FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| username |
+----------+
| bobby    |
| devdojo  |
| tony     |
| bobby    |
| devdojo  |
| tony     |
+----------+
```

As you can see, each name is present multiple times in the list. We have 2 times `bobby`, 2 times `devdjo` and 2 times `tony`.

If we wanted to show only the unique `usernames`, we could add the `DISTINCT` keyword to our select statement:

```
SELECT DISTINCT username FROM users;
```

Output:

```
+----------+
| username |
+----------+
| bobby    |
| devdojo  |
| tony     |
+----------+
```

As you can see, the duplicate entries have been removed from the output.

## Conclusion

The `SELECT` statement is essential whenever working with SQL. In the next chapter, we are going to learn how to use the `WHERE` clause and take the `SELECT` statements to the next level.
