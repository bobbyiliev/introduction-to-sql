# Sorting with ORDER and GROUP BY

In the last chapter, you've learned how to use the `SELECT` statement with the `WHERE` clause and filter the result set based on some conditions.

More often than not, you would want to order the results in a specific way based on a particular column. For example, you might want to order the users, alphabetically, based on their username.

In this chapter, you will learn how to use the `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses.

## ORDER BY

The main thing that you need to keep in mind when using `ORDER BY` is that you need to specify the column or columns that you want to order by. In case that you want to specify multiple columns to order by, you need to separate each column with a comma.

If we were to run the following statement without providing an `ORDER BY` clause:

```
SELECT id,username FROM users ;
```

We will get the following output:

```
+----+----------+
| id | username |
+----+----------+
|  2 | bobby    |
|  3 | devdojo  |
|  4 | tony     |
|  5 | bobby    |
|  6 | devdojo  |
|  7 | tony     |
+----+----------+
```

As you can see, the result set is sorted by the primary key, which in our case is the `id` of each user. If we wanted to sort the output by `username`, we would run the following query:

```
SELECT id,username FROM users ORDER BY username;
```

> Note:The `ORDER BY` statement is followed by the name of the column that we want to order by.

The output in this case will be:

```
+----+----------+
| id | username |
+----+----------+
|  2 | bobby    |
|  5 | bobby    |
|  3 | devdojo  |
|  6 | devdojo  |
|  4 | tony     |
|  7 | tony     |
+----+----------+
```

> Note: You can use `ORDER BY` with and without specifying a `WHERE` clause. But in case that you've specified a `WHERE` clause, you need to put the `ORDER BY` clause after the `WHERE` clause.

The default sorting is ascending and is specified with the `ASC` keyword, and you don't need to explicitly add it, but if you want to sort by descending order, you need to use the `DESC` keyword.

If we use the query above and just add `DESC` at the end as follows:

```
SELECT id,username FROM users ORDER BY username DESC;
```

We will see the following output:

```
+----+----------+
| id | username |
+----+----------+
|  4 | tony     |
|  7 | tony     |
|  3 | devdojo  |
|  6 | devdojo  |
|  2 | bobby    |
|  5 | bobby    |
+----+----------+
```

As you can see, we've got the same list of users sorted alphabetically but in reverse order.

## GROUP BY

The `GROUP BY` statement allows you to use a function like `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX` and etc., with multiple columns.

For example, let's say that we wanted to get all of the count of all users grouped by username.

In our case, we have 2 users with username `bobby`, 2 users with username `tony`, and 2 users with username `devdojo`. This represented in an SQL statement would look like this:

```
SELECT COUNT(username), username FROM users GROUP by username;
```

The output, in this case, would be:

```
+-----------------+----------+
| COUNT(username) | username |
+-----------------+----------+
|               2 | bobby    |
|               2 | devdojo  |
|               2 | tony     |
+-----------------+----------+
```

The `GROUP BY` statement grouped the usernames that were identical. So `bobby`, `tony` and `devdojo`, and then it ran a `COUNT` on each of them.

The main thing to keep in mind here is that the `GROUP BY` should be added after the `FROM` clause and after the WHERE clause in case that you have one.

## HAVING Clause

The `HAVING` clause allows you to filter out the results on the groups formed by `GROUP BY` clause.

For example, let's say that we wanted to get all usernames which are duplicate, i.e., all the usernames which are present in more than one table record.

In our case, we have 2 users with username `bobby`, 2 users with username `tony`, and 2 users with username `devdojo`. This represented in an SQL statement would look like this:

```
SELECT COUNT(username), username FROM users GROUP by username HAVING COUNT(username) > 1;
```

The output, in this case, would be:

```
+-----------------+----------+
| COUNT(username) | username |
+-----------------+----------+
|               2 | bobby    |
|               2 | devdojo  |
|               2 | tony     |
+-----------------+----------+
```

The `GROUP BY` clause grouped the usernames that were identical, calculated their counts and then the groups were filtered out using `HAVING` clause.

> **NOTE** :- _The WHERE clause places conditions on the selected columns, whereas the HAVING clause places conditions on groups created by the GROUP BY clause._
